- It's normal!
- Pages still work
- Just uses in-memory sorting
- No action needed

### Empty Pages:
If pages show "No books yet":
- Add books in admin panel
- Make sure status = 'active'
- Check Firestore rules

### Discount Calculation:
Offers page shows random discounts:
- 20-50% OFF (random for each book)
